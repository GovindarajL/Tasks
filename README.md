# Tasks

I Love Documenting my work and the tasks that I have and this is my Strength and this will motivates me to do the work.

And Appreciation, Encouragement and Motivation is the key to do my work happily and whenever I feel stressed I motivate myself and that gives a energy. And whenever I feel sad instead of I write it in my notes/document so that it gives me relief and helps to find the solutions for problems.
